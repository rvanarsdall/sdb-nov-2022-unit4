/*
FIZZBUZZ LOOP CHALLENGE (pair coding)
************
- write a conditional that:
        - prints out "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
        - prints out "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
        - prints out "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5
        - prints out the number if none of the above are true.
- create a loop that counts to 100.
